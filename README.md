# Game-of-Hog-Deep-Q-Learning-ANN
This project was created to learn more about reinforcement learning and how it works. The model didn't perform too well, with only a 59-60% win rate. With tuning,
the model did perform at 63-64%; however, the model was overly complex and unnecessary. Possible improvements might come from using a CNN instead of an ANN, changing
how rewards are given, and more fine-tuning of hyperparameters. Feel free to improve if you want!
